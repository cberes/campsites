The goal of this project is to build a campsite reservations system from scratch. The project will allow users to

- learn about a campgrounds
- view available campsites
- reserve campsites
- pay for reservations
- manage paid reservations

I started this project to show off my talents as a software engineer. I'm currently employed as a full-time software engineer, but I figure it can't hurt to make something that will set me apart from other potential hires. I don't plan on leaving my job soon, but I want to be prepared. A few weeks prior to my writing this, the company I work for had a round of layoffs. I don't expect to be laid off soon, but I don't want to be caught with my pants down, so to speak.

I've decided that I'll blog about this project while I work on it. I expect it will add some legitimacy to the project. Also, the blog gives me a platform to explain my decisions, highlight features that I've added, and to prove my communication skills. Originally, I planned to live-code this project, but I stopped that for a couple reasons

0. I lost my first 2 videos when they dropped off [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) before I exported them to YouTube
0. I realized I'm rarely in the mood both to write software and to chat in great detail about the software I'm writing

Why campsite reservations? Well, I'm passionate about camping! Just last week I returned from a camping trip to Arches, Canyonlands, and Bryce Canyon National Parks. Also, while I was applying for my current job, I was turned down by a company that was building a camping reservations platform. It felt really silly to me, because I have both the passion for the job and the required technical skills. Since they denied me the opporunity to do this for a living, I'll do it for fun instead!

My goal is to build a project that is both easy to deploy and cheap to maintain. My plan is to have a static website that can be hosted for free. I plan on using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for the frontend, because it's a technology I'd like to learn. The website will leverage Java web services built with [Spring](https://spring.io/). I chose Spring (and Java) because it's the framework I have the most experience with, so it should be the most effective way to demonstrate my abilities. Finally, to make the project easy to deploy, I believe I'll need to add some dev-ops glue, possibly including [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.

I plan to update this blog occassionally as I progress with the project. In my next post, I'll explain the work I've done so far.
