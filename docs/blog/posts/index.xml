      <description>As I said in my last post, I&amp;rsquo;ve already started working on my campsites project. I had already recorded two live programming sessions, but those videos are gone forever.
So far, I built a very simple static website. When I build RESTful services (that return mock data initially), I&amp;rsquo;ll use this website to display the data. The website is very simple and ugly right now. I&amp;rsquo;ll worry about the aesthetics later.</description>

      <description>The goal of this project is to build a campsite reservations system from scratch. The project will allow users to
 learn about a campgrounds view available campsites reserve campsites pay for reservations manage paid reservations  I started this project to show off my talents as a software engineer. I&amp;rsquo;m currently employed as a full-time software engineer, but I figure it can&amp;rsquo;t hurt to make something that will set me apart from other potential hires.</description>
