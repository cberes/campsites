      <description>I was happy to get my hands on a copy of the third edition of &amp;ldquo;Effective Java&amp;rdquo; by Joshua Bloch. Near the end of chapter 4, he concludes his thoughts on modules as follows
 It is too early to say whether modules will achieve widespread use outside of the JDK itself. In the meantime, it seems best to avoid them unless you have a compelling need.
 I decided I have no compelling need to use Java&amp;rsquo;s module system, so I have removed the module declarations from my project.</description>

      <description>I have fixed every test in the campsites project, and I even added new tests. The tests were broken by a combination of things: Java 9&amp;rsquo;s module system, switching from mocked data to a real database, and some confusion with Junit 5. Since my last post, I fixed those problems.
Junit 5 The biggest blocker that I faced was my failure to get my tests running. I decided to use Junit 5.</description>

      <title>The Jigsaw Puzzle</title>

      <description>Since my last update at the beginning of October, I updated the REST controllers to read data from a database (PostgreSQL in this case). Previously they read from data stored in a Java array.
Querying the database Spring makes it very easy to read from a database using JPA. I chose to use this approach. Spring handles all of the implementation. It does the basics (create, read, update, delete), and it can generate more complex queries based on functions&amp;rsquo; names.</description>

      <title>Vue.js Testing</title>

      <description>Since my last update, I added new mock services to the Spring backend and new components to the Vue.js frontend. I added mock campsite, area, and availability services, and I added to the mock campground service. I added (real, not mock) controllers for those services. In the frontend, I added the campsite, campsite-list, availabilty-calendar, and quick-availability components.
The Java changes were very straightforward. It&amp;rsquo;s trivial to keep fake data in memory.</description>

      <title>What I&#39;ve Done So Far</title>

      <description>As I said in my last post, I&amp;rsquo;ve already started working on my campsites project. I had already recorded two live programming sessions, but those videos are gone forever.
So far, I built a very simple static website. When I build RESTful services (that return mock data initially), I&amp;rsquo;ll use this website to display the data. The website is very simple and ugly right now. I&amp;rsquo;ll worry about the aesthetics later.</description>

      <description>The goal of this project is to build a campsite reservations system from scratch. The project will allow users to
 learn about a campgrounds view available campsites reserve campsites pay for reservations manage paid reservations  I started this project to show off my talents as a software engineer. I&amp;rsquo;m currently employed as a full-time software engineer, but I figure it can&amp;rsquo;t hurt to make something that will set me apart from other potential hires.</description>
